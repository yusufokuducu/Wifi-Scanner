## Overview

Network Scanner is a Python-based ARP network scanning application designed to quickly discover devices on your local network. With a user-friendly graphical interface built using CustomTkinter, this tool offers real-time scanning results, CSV export functionality, and robust error handling. It ensures secure operation by requiring administrative privileges for sensitive network operations.

## Features

- **ARP Scanning**: Leverages Scapy for fast and accurate ARP-based network scanning.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: A clean, responsive interface built with CustomTkinter.
- **Network Interface Selection**: Automatically detects and allows selection of available network interfaces.
- **MAC Vendor Lookup**: Identifies device manufacturers using MAC address lookup.
- **CSV Export**: Export scan results easily to CSV for further analysis.
- **Admin Checks**: Verifies administrative rights to ensure safe scanning operations.
- **Multi-Threaded Scanning**: Runs scans in a separate thread to keep the UI responsive.
- **Progress Indication**: Visual feedback during scanning operations.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging for better diagnostics.

## Requirements

3. For Windows users, install [Npcap](https://npcap.com/) or [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/) for packet capture capabilities.

## Usage

1. Run the application with administrator/root privileges for full functionality:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell with admin rights)
python main.py

# Linux/macOS
sudo python main.py
```

2. Navigate through the tabbed interface:
   - **Network Scan**: Perform network scans and view basic results
   - **Device List**: View detailed device information in a table format
   - **Network Graph**: Visualize your network by vendor distribution
   - **Settings**: Configure application preferences

3. Scanning Your Network:
   - Select a network interface from the dropdown menu
   - Choose a scan type (Standard, Quick, or Detailed)
   - Click "Start Scan" to begin scanning
   - View results in either text or table format

4. Additional Features:
   - Double-click on any device in the table for detailed information
   - Right-click on devices for additional options (Ping, Open in browser)
   - Filter devices using the search box in the Device List tab
   - Generate network visualizations as pie or bar charts
   - Configure auto-refresh to periodically scan your network
   - Customize the application theme (light/dark)
   - Export scan results to CSV files

## Troubleshooting

- **Admin Privileges Required**: The application needs administrator privileges for ARP scanning. If you see a warning about admin rights, restart the application as an administrator.
- **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter dependency errors, make sure you've installed all required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
